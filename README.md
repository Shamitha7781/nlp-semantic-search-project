# nlp-semantic-search-project
NLP project comparing Word2Vec, BERT, and Sentence-BERT for semantic search on large-scale unstructured text data. Focuses on text preprocessing, embedding generation, cosine similarity, and evaluating contextual relevance beyond keyword-based search.
🔎 Problem Statement

Organizations often deal with large volumes of unstructured text such as reviews, feedback, or open-ended responses. Keyword-based search systems struggle to retrieve relevant content when phrasing differs, intent is implicit, or sentiment is nuanced.

This project evaluates semantic search approaches using Word2Vec, BERT, and Sentence-BERT to determine which model most effectively retrieves contextually relevant documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords.
🗂️ Dataset

IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset

50,000 labeled text reviews (positive & negative)

Long, unstructured, sentiment-heavy text — ideal for semantic search evaluation

📌 The dataset is publicly available and not included in this repository.

🧠 Models Implemented
🔹 Word2Vec

Learns word-level embeddings using local context windows

Sentence embeddings generated by averaging word vectors

Fast but limited in capturing sentence-level meaning

🔹 BERT

Transformer-based model with bidirectional context understanding

Fine-tuned for sentiment classification

Embeddings adapted for semantic similarity

🔹 Sentence-BERT

Optimized specifically for semantic similarity tasks

Generates fixed-length sentence embeddings

Best overall performance for semantic search

📊 Evaluation & Results

Word2Vec: Captures basic semantic similarity but struggles with context

BERT: Strong contextual understanding but slower for large-scale retrieval

Sentence-BERT: Most accurate and efficient for semantic search tasks

📌 Sentence-BERT consistently retrieved the most contextually relevant documents for a given query.

💡 Example Use Cases
